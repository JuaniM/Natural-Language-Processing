# Natural-Language-Processing

At this opportunity I practiced <em> Natural Language Processing</em> by building a model that interprets a given lyric and tells you which genre the song is. I vectorized with a pre-trained <em> word embeddings' </em> layer (The Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) developed by The Stanford University Natural Language Processing Group -available <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip"> here </a>-) and then trained the entire neural network with a dataset of lyrics for prediction. A <em> softmax non-linear function </em> finally categorizes the output.

The repository includes all the .ipynb and the .csv used.
