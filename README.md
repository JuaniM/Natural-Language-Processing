# Natural-Language-Processing

At this opportunity I practiced <em> Natural Language Processing</em>, building a model that interprets a given lyric and tells you which genre the song is. I vectorized with a pre-trained <em> word embeddings' </em> layer ('GloVe', available at Stanford) and then trained the entire neural network with a dataset of lyrics for prediction. A <em> softmax non-linear function </em> finally categorizes the output.

The repository includes all the .ipynb and the .csv used.
